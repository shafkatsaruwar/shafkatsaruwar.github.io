        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>I'm an IT professional transitioning into software development, with hands-on experience in system administration, technical support, and automation. I graduated from UMass Boston with a B.S. in Information Technology (Class of 2024) and have been building my development skills through personal projects and self-study.</p>

        <p>My background in IT support has given me a strong foundation in troubleshooting, system infrastructure, and working with production environments. Now I'm channeling that experience into software development, focusing on automation tools, web applications, and scripting.</p>

        <p>I'm particularly interested in roles that bridge IT operations and software development—like DevOps, infrastructure engineering, or backend development—where I can leverage both my operational experience and growing programming skills.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I've worked in IT support roles at Nexworks and Mass General Brigham, where I managed user accounts, deployed workstations, troubleshot technical issues, and improved documentation processes. These experiences taught me how to work under pressure, communicate technical concepts clearly, and solve problems methodically.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I build projects that automate repetitive tasks and solve real problems—like organizing photos, processing payroll, or helping people discover national parks. Each project is a chance to learn new technologies and improve my development skills.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><strong>University of Massachusetts, Boston</strong><br>
        B.S. Information Technology, Class of 2024<br>
        Concentration GPA: 3.75</p>

        <p>Relevant coursework: Cloud Integration Methodologies (AWS), Database Management, Systems Analysis & Design, Software Development, Networking</p>

        <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
        <p>Currently deepening my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, practicing problem-solving through coding challenges, and exploring backend development patterns. I'm committed to continuous learning and transitioning fully into software engineering.</p>
